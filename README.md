# Team Players

This app is being created to learn more about Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room databases, NavController, ViewModels, Dependency Injection and more.

Purpose of the app:

I watched a kids American football game and saw someone on the sidelines recording which players were in each play on paper. 

Their goal was to make sure that each player participated in at least 8 plays before the game ended. It was hectic for them to find the players on the page before the next play started. With timeouts and penalties in the game, sometimes they would have to undo a tally of a player.

This app will store a list of Teams, Players, and Fotball Games. Teams have both players and games.

I decided that when a game is created for a team... a snap shot of the list of players is added to that specific game. This allows for the players on a team to change 
without affecting a past game's data.

Design is stored in PowerPoint file

NOTE:
My 2nd Kotlin app. (My first being the first pass at this app, but nearly everything in one file and without a database)
